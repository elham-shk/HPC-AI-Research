**Exploring Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, an advanced version of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), for time-series prediction tasks.** It is based on  the original LSTM framework introduced by [Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997)](Hochreiter, S., & Schmidhuber, J. (1997). Long short-term memory. Neural computation, 9(8), 1735-1780).
